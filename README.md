This is a revision of Earls-Nano-Stepper which supported a single stepper motor with an Arduino Nano, a ULN2003 high current driver, a molex connector
for the stepper and inputs for home sensors.  This version uses a ULN2803 with 8 segments to support 2 steppers (4 ea), 2 molex connectors and 2 home sensors.
